## 1. Sinatra

Build a Sinatra app with at least 3 routes.

Some ideas:

* Elevator status check
* Take user input and display it reversed
* Paste text into a box and display a count of letters
* Run a game (like the guessing game) through a web app
  * Note: you'll need to use something like `session` to
    store state between requests
* Display data from an external API like `api.github.com/users/<username>/repos`
  * Will need to use something like HTTParty and JSON.parse

Bonus: deploy it to Heroku
