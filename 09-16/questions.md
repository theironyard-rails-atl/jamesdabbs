Today's lecture was mostly a refresher on testing things. Make sure your team has merged in the tests I've added from upstream and that all tests still pass.

No specific assignments for today, but I will expect this week's project to have good spec coverage when complete, and would encourage you to write tests first / try out testing client-side using Selenium or Poltergeist.
