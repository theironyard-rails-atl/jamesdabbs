# Background Workers

Today we'll be adding background workers to the Iron Shop project in order to send emails out-of-band.

Main points:

* Rough idea of how a work queue system is structured
* How to implement one, both in Rails 4.2 and before
* Differentiating points between the available worker systems

## Homework

Continue working on your group project, with an eye towards:

* Sending emails in the background
* The "price watch notification" feature (this could be a periodic job, or some other mechanism)
