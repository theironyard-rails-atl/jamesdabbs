# APIs and Testing

## Summary

Today will be a closer look at how to approach interacting with an API inside of a Rails app, focusing on:

* TDD'ing from feature to unit specs
* Designing a flexible and testable object to mediate the API interaction
* Strategies for testing that object without making extraneous API calls

## Homework

Continue group work on your projects. Add to your backlog:

* Your project should be able to hit an external service (Google books is fine, Amazon is an option) to get extra data.
* That API interaction should be fully tested.
