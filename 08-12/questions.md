## 1. Sinatra, Encore

Add an endpoint to your Sintra application (or make
a new app) that gets data from an external API.

Some big ones to consider:

* Github
* Twitter
* Meetup
* Spotify

Bonus: make calls that require authentication (this
could look very different on different applications).

## 2. Rails

Be sure you've read the Rails guides assigned yesterday.
If you want to dig deeper, there are [other guides]() on:

* [Layouts and rendering](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html) - this should
  feel mostly similar to your experience with Sinatra.
* [Active record](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html) - this is how Rails
  apps primarily interact with a database and store information
* [Controllers](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html) - Sinatra endpoint
  handlers aren't object oriented, and thus can be hard to reuse. The corresponding notion for
  larger apps is a controller object.
