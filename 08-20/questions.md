# Group Work - Job Board

Start working on the ATLRUG Job Board in teams. Some recommendations:

* Create a Github organization for your group
* Fork the existing work from class into a repo owned by your new organization
* Each group member should clone down and work on that repo
* Plan out and divvy up work by features
* Work should be done in feature branches
* Branches should be closed via a pull request, preferrably reviewed
  by someone other than its author.

Let me know if you have any git / merge troubles.

Feature-wise, it's largely up to each team to determine which features to
implement, but you should at least start with

* Listing favorited job postings
* Enforcing that the (user,job) pair is unique for each favorite

We'll present on Monday, and try to combine the best parts and push to production from there if possible.
