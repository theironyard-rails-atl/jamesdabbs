# SQL in Depth

This lesson is an exploration of the SQL that ActiveRecord generates and how to write equivalent (or more complex) queries directly.

## Summary

* Connecting directly to an SQL console, rather than a Rails console
* Basic operators: SELECT, WHERE, LIMIT, OFFSET, ORDER BY, GROUP BY
* JOIN as gluing tables together
* The impact of indexing on query performance
