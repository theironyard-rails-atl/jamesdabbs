# Stripe

Today, we continue implementing features for the Iron Shop project, starting in class from [the reference model implementation branch](https://github.com/theironyard-rails-atl/iron-shop/tree/reference-model-implementation).

See also the [in-class commits](https://github.com/theironyard-rails-atl/iron-shop/compare/6c2f7a7da9c2b80e1e98ed04f686c3e314f3a120...aad8cb030330e10c5ef85066c64c12c162f98a80).

# Homework

Be sure your previous team project is deployed to Heroku and linked to on the [class homework tracker](http://tiy-homework.herokuapp.com/homeworks)

* Make sure your development applications are running on Postgres (which is fairly easy to set up with e.g. [postgres.app](http://postgresapp.com/))
* You should now be able to tackle the "pay with Stripe" item in your backlog, so begin working on that
* Continue designing and building the remaining features in your team backlog
