Either or both:

1. Continue working on your weekend project, adding a Devise-backed User model

2. Starting with the [jobs-board]() app we worked on today, add the following:
  * A job index which lists active job postings
  * Allow users to edit posts, but only those posts that they created
  * Let users flag posts (post will not be displayed for that user) or favorite
    (posts will show up in a user's favorites list). You will most likely need
    a User <-> Job join model for this one.
  * Time permitting, think about searching and filtering.
