# Para Hoy

1. Fork the existing project into a team-accessible repo
2. Decide on and implement any process tools your team would like to use (Hipchat room, Trello board, Github org)
3. Set up OAuth signins using at least 2 different providers
4. Plan out how your team would like to implement upcoming features (note that you will be pulling in changes from the upstream repo as we work in class).

Time permitting, review JS and consider attending the Javascript meetup tonight.


# Features

Your team should flesh out requirements for, plan, and implement

* Categories / tagging
* Search, including category filtering
* Pulling product data from an external API (e.g. Amazon or Google Books)
* Image uploads for products
* User images from OAuth provider

We will additionally be working on some or all of the following features in class, and pulling in these changes from upstream

* Testing (inc. testing mailers and javascript environments)
* Emails - confirmation and password reset
* Stripe, handling payments
* Query performance - n+1s, indexes, etc.
