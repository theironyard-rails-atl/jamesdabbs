# Iron Shop

## Summary

This week begins a new project, available [on Github](https://github.com/theironyard-rails-atl/iron-shop). See the README for project details.

Today we'll look at model specs in a bit more detail using some models that are more than just buckets of table data.

## Homework

Individually, you should each

* Look over the model specs
* Get the model specs passing (without changing the specs!)

Additionally, form teams for working on the project for the week (max 4 people) and

* Designate a scrummaster
* Fork the project to a team-managed repo for collaboration
* Prioritize and delineate features
* Begin working on fleshing out the feature specs (definition, implementation, and additional features)
