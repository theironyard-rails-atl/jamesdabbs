## 1. Data, data, data

Take a look at the included `widgets.yml` file. Write a Ruby
script to find

* The most and least expensive widget
* The total revenue and profit from all widgets sold
* The top 10 best selling widgets
* The number of widgets sold in each department


## 2. Would You Like to Play a Game?

Using all your Ruby object prowess, design a playable game.
You should use at least 4 classes, at least 2 of which are
subclasses of a single parent.

Ideas:

* Adapt liberally from the rougelike presented in class
* Design a racing game, with different classes of cars that
  have different speeds and abilities
