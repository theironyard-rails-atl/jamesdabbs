## 1. Data, data, data

Take a look at the included `widgets.yml` file. Write a Ruby
script to find

* The most and least expensive widget
* The total revenue and profit from all widgets sold
* The top 10 best selling widgets
* The number of widgets sold in each department

You'll need to -

Read the list of widgets from the YAML file: http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/yaml/rdoc/YAML.html
Use appropriate methods from Enumerable: http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/Enumerable.html (lists are Enumerable!)


## 2. Would You Like to Play a Game?

Using all your Ruby object prowess, design a playable game.
You should use at least 4 classes, at least 2 of which are
subclasses of a single parent.

Ideas:

* Adapt liberally from the rougelike presented in class
* Design a racing game, with different classes of cars that
  have different speeds and abilities
* Program a known game - if the game logic doesn't lend itself
  to subclassing, you might think about having different player /
  opponent classes (where the "AI" has different play strategies)
  - The hangman game with opponents that know about the dictionary?
  - Battleship
  - Other ideas?
